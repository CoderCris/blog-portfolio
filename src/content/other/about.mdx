I'm a software developer focused on backend systems, infrastructure, and cybersecurity. I enjoy learning deeply, automating smartly, and working with people who value clarity and collaboration.

My background blends DevOps, CI/CD, cloud security, and a bit of music-making for creative balance. I care about building things that are efficient, secure, and human-aware.
